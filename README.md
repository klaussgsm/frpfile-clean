# frpfile clean

This is purely just a decompiled .sln project for FRPFile (Version who cares) that originally had AgileNET on it with CSVM enabled. All of this is (hopefully) removed & is up for anyone to view.

This is PURELY for research & reverse engineering purposes. I don't care if you get into legal trouble and it certainly isn't my issue either (you'd probably not get any due to any EULA at all so lel).

This is believed however to use code from OC34N R2 which can be obtained at https://github.com/Thelittlechicken/oc34n-r2, I can't confirm IF some code is stolen (UI & some elements look very similar but I might post an update if this is confirmed.

also follow me on twitter for @akakult for more dumb stuff ok bye

NOTE: I don't have anything against FRPFILE at all. I do reverse engineering as a side hobby & am simply using this as a statement as people should be aware of their privacy & device security. Your antivirus software (Windows Defender, Norton, etc.) also might got off due to some parts of the code protection still being present. This does NOT mean this a virus (you can simply look over the code if you want to double check), this is just a false positive from Windows Defender.
