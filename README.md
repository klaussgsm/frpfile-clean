# frpfile clean

This is purely just a decompiled .sln project for FRPFile (Version who cares.

This is PURELY for research & reverse engineering purposes. I don't care if you get into legal trouble and it certainly isn't my issue either (you'd probably not get any due to any EULA at all so lel).

This is believed however to use code from OC34N R2 which can be obtained at https://github.com/Thelittlechicken/oc34n-r2, I can't confirm IF some code is stolen (UI & some lements look very similar but I might post an update if this is confirmed.

also follow me on twitter for @akakult for more dumb stuff ok bye
